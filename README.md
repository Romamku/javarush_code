# Криптоанализатор

### **[Итоговый проект к курсу Java Syntax. Javarush.]()**
This console application works with Caesar’s cipher. 
The cryptographic alphabet is based on all letters of the Russian 
alphabet and punctuation signs (. , ”” : - ! ? ПРОБЕЛ).
If you come across symbols that are not in our cryptographic alphabet, they are ignored.

The program has 4 modes:
1. Text encryption using a cryptographic key;
2. Decryption of text using a cryptographic key;
3. Brute Force cryptanalysis;
4. Cryptanalysis by statistical analysis.

The user has the opportunity to choose one of the four modes of operation.

To start using the program, you need to create three text files in the root directory:
1. text.txt - to store the source code;
2. code.txt - for storing encoded text;
3. anyText.txt - to store the text used in statistical analysis.

All further instructions and hints will be reflected in the console.
